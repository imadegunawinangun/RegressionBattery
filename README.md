this repository contains machine learning project - predicting one output value from six hundred variables of supercapacitor in racing car.

Overall, there are four steps to make this model predicting one output value from five hundred and seventy six data containing six hundred variables of supercapacitor.

The first step, the data is downloaded from github to colabolatory. After the data is transferred to colabolatory, it's checked. 
if the distribution of the data is not relative good, stabilization mechanism is applied to data. after this, normalisation is applied to it. 
the data is seperated into data training and validation data. a sequencial model is prepared to be learned by inputing normalized data.
the model is ready to predict output.
